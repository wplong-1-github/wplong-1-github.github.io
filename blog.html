    I have to put most of my time on the qualifying exam. If not, I am dead. Anybody who doesn't produce any product at any time is dying.
    What you should do today:
    <ul>
      <li> let your cloth washed </li>
      <li> reading statistical book </li>
    </ul>
    What you should do everyday:
    <ul>
      <li> wake up at 6:30am </li>
      <li> running in the morning </li>
      <li> wear your kneecap </li>

      <li> sleep at 11:00pm </li>
    </ul>
